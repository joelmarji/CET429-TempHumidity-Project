# CET429-TempHumidity-Project
 Repository for all files related to the temperature/humidity sensor project. Developed by Joel Marji and Calvin Jantz for CET 429 at SUNY Polytechnic institute. 
 
 This project uses an Arduino UNO R3 with WiFi capability to measure the temperature and humidity of a room using a DHT11 Temp Sensor. The Data is then displayed on an LCD display using the Arduino Liquid Crystal library. The Arduino is connected to the users personal WiFi, and the website is generated locally and accessed through the Arduino's IP address. Temperature and humidity data is also sent to ThingSpeak, where the data is plotted and can be exported.
